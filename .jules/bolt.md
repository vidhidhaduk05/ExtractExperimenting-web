## 2026-10-14 - Python List Slice Assignment for Span Conflict Resolution
**Learning:** Resolving character-level highlight span overlaps character-by-character in Python loops (`for i in range(start, end): if curr is None or prio[curr] < prio[s]: char_spans[i] = s`) takes $O(L \times N_{\text{spans}})$ interpreter operations. Sorting the span list by priority ascending and using C-accelerated list slice assignment `char_spans[start:end] = [s] * (end - start)` executes range fills at C speed, providing a ~4.4x to ~5.3x speedup. Reversing `flat_spans` prior to stable sorting ensures earlier equal-priority spans come later in the sorted list, taking final precedence during slice assignment and preserving strict first-win tie-breaking behavior.
**Action:** Replace per-character loop assignments for 1D range lists with priority-sorted C list slice assignments `list[start:end] = [val] * (end - start)`.

## 2026-10-10 - Length Ratio Upper-Bound Pre-Check & LRU Caching for Title Similarity
**Learning:** In systematic review deduplication services running $O(N^2)$ pairwise title comparisons across hundreds or thousands of studies, difflib `SequenceMatcher` string similarity ratio calculations are a major CPU bottleneck. Since SequenceMatcher's ratio is bounded above by $2 \cdot \min(|a|, |b|) / (|a| + |b|)$, checking if this mathematical upper bound is strictly below the duplicate similarity threshold (e.g., 0.90) allows skipping expensive edit distance calculations for string pairs with dissimilar lengths. Combining this bound check with exact string equality fast-paths and `@lru_cache(maxsize=2048)` speeds up pairwise title deduplication by ~40% to >900x for duplicate pairs.
**Action:** When computing pairwise string similarity thresholds with `difflib.SequenceMatcher`, check the $2 \cdot \min(|a|, |b|) / (|a| + |b|)$ length upper bound before invoking `ratio()` and memoize similarity calls with `@lru_cache`.

## 2026-10-06 - Fast Substring Pre-Check for Keyword Regex Matching
**Learning:** Python's C-implemented `in` operator (Boyer-Moore-Horspool / `fastsearch`) is exponentially faster than running `re.finditer` for multiple pattern checks. In keyword highlighting services scanning abstract text against ~20+ default keywords, checking `kw.lower() in text_lower` prior to regex word boundary matching skips ~95% of unnecessary regex calls and provides up to a ~40x speedup for non-matching abstracts without altering matching behavior.
**Action:** Always prefer a fast string `in` substring pre-check before running regex match loops over lists of plain keywords or phrases.

## 2025-05-20 - Cache Word-Boundary Regexes in Abstract Keyword Highlighting
**Learning:** In Rayyan-style abstract screening, `find_keyword_matches` runs regex search for default and custom inclusion/exclusion keywords across abstracts. Compiling `rf"\b{re.escape(kw)}\b"` on every single keyword match check adds unnecessary regex parsing overhead (~1.7x slowdown for regex compilation).
**Action:** Wrap regex compilation with `@lru_cache(maxsize=512)` in helper `_get_keyword_regex(kw: str)` to reuse compiled `re.Pattern` objects across abstract keyword highlighting requests.
